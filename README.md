# Team Orienteering Problem (TOP)

This repository contains the code and files necessary to solve the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) using a combination of optimization techniques: GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Variable Neighborhood Search (VND).

## General Problem Description

The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) is a variant of the vehicle routing problem where the objective is to maximize the total profits accumulated by a team of vehicles visiting a set of points while respecting time and capacity constraints. In TOP, each point has an associated profit, and vehicles must decide which points to visit to maximize the total profit without exceeding their operational limits.

## Models Used

### 1. GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure)

GRASP is a multi-start metaheuristic that iteratively builds feasible solutions and then applies local search to improve those solutions. This model is useful for generating a diverse initial population of feasible solutions for the TOP. The main steps include:

- **Construction**: Generate initial solutions using a greedy approach that randomly selects points to visit based on a profit function.
- **Local Search**: Refine the constructed solutions by exploring their neighborhoods to find local improvements.

### 2. Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Genetic Algorithms are optimization techniques inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics. This model is used to evolve the solution population generated by GRASP. The main steps include:

- **Selection**: Choose the fittest solutions from the current population to be parents for the next generation.
- **Crossover**: Combine pairs of parent solutions to produce offspring that inherit traits from both parents.
- **Mutation**: Introduce random changes in the offspring to maintain genetic diversity within the population.

### 3. Genetic Algorithm combined with Variable Neighborhood Search (GA-VND)

GA-VND is a variant of the Genetic Algorithm that incorporates Variable Neighborhood Search techniques to further improve the generated solutions. Variable Neighborhood Search applies different local search operators to explore multiple neighborhoods of a solution. The main steps include:

- **Crossover and Mutation**: Same as in the standard GA.
- **Variable Neighborhood Search (VND)**: Apply a sequence of local search operators to different neighborhoods of each solution, iteratively improving their quality.
